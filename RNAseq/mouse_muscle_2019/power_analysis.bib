abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Muscle denervation resulting from injury, disease or aging results in impaired motor function. Restoring neuromuscular communication requires axonal regrowth and endplate reinnervation. Muscle activity inhibits the reinnervation of denervated muscle. The mechanism by which muscle activity regulates muscle reinnervation is poorly understood. Dach2 and Hdac9 are activity-regulated transcriptional co-repressors that are highly expressed in innervated muscle and suppressed following muscle denervation. Dach2 and Hdac9 control the expression of endplate-associated genes such as those encoding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here we tested the idea that Dach2 and Hdac9 mediate the effects of muscle activity on muscle reinnervation. Dach2 and Hdac9 were found to act in a collaborative fashion to inhibit reinnervation of denervated mouse skeletal muscle and appear to act, at least in part, by inhibiting denervation-dependent induction of Myog and Gdf5 gene expression. Although Dach2 and Hdac9 inhibit Myog and Gdf5 mRNA expression, Myog does not regulate Gdf5 transcription. Thus, Myog and Gdf5 appear to stimulate muscle reinnervation through parallel pathways. These studies suggest that manipulating the Dach2-Hdac9 signaling system, and Gdf5 in particular, might be a good approach for enhancing motor function in instances where neuromuscular communication has been disrupted.},

abstract = {One of the most important and often neglected components of a successful RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiment is sample size estimation. A few negative binomial model-based methods have been developed to estimate sample size based on the parameters of a single gene. However, thousands of genes are quantified and tested for differential expression simultaneously in RNA-Seq experiments. Thus, additional issues should be carefully addressed, including the false discovery rate for multiple statistic tests, widely distributed read counts and dispersions for different genes. To solve these issues, we developed a sample size and power estimation method named RnaSeqSampleSize, based on the distributions of gene average read counts and dispersions estimated from real RNA-seq data. Datasets from previous, similar experiments such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) can be used as a point of reference. Read counts and their dispersions were estimated from the reference's distribution; using that information, we estimated and summarized the power and sample size. RnaSeqSampleSize is implemented in R language and can be installed from Bioconductor website. A user friendly web graphic interface is provided at

                  . RnaSeqSampleSize provides a convenient and powerful way for power and sample size estimation for an RNAseq experiment. It is also equipped with several unique features, including estimation for interested genes or pathway, power curve visualization, and parameter optimization.},
